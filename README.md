# system-design-case-studies
Implementation of few system design cases


ðŸ”§ System Design Case Studies
A curated collection of real-world system design projects, focused on building scalable, fault-tolerant, and production-grade architectures. 
Each case study includes architectural decisions, trade-off analysis (based on CAP theorem, latency, cost, and availability), and hands-on implementation in Java/Spring Boot/Python, Redis, Kafka, and cloud-native components, DBs and so on

ðŸ“Œ Included Topics:

1)  Distributed URL Shortener System (multi-region, fault-tolerant)


ðŸ“‚ Goal:
To demonstrate practical system design through complete, well-documented, and testable implementations that can serve as a learning platform or interview prep resource.
