## ðŸ”§ System Design Case Studies

A curated collection of system design projects focused on building scalable, fault-tolerant, and production-grade architectures.  
Each case study includes architectural decisions, trade-off analysis (CAP theorem, latency, availability, cost), and hands-on implementation using Java, Spring Boot, Python, Redis, Kafka, cloud-native tools, and modern databases.

## ðŸ“Œ Included Topics

1. **Distributed URL Shortener System**  
   A multi-region, fault-tolerant service that handles URL deduplication, token generation, and scaling challenges with CAP-aware design.

2. **User Onboarding System** designed to manage user registration, authentication, and role-based access control.

## ðŸ“‚ Goal

To demonstrate practical system design through well-documented and testable implementations that can serve as:
- A learning platform
- A reference for real-world projects
- Interview preparation material for system design rounds
